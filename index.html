				<p class="p-1"> My name is Jason Martin and I am a Colorado native.  I have been married for 23 years and have 3 teenage children.
				I have been in IT for over 20 years while spending most of that time as a Sr. Systems Engineer building infrastructure in data centers, and more recently
				Amazon's AWS cloud. I am currently working as a Sr. Security Architect and I'm interested in moving onto a red team that conducts penetration testing
				against web applications and infrastructure.  I received my Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH) certificate this year and want to expand on that knowledge
				by learning full stack web development.  All of my programming has been self taught over the years, so there are many gaps that need to be filled.
				</p>
				<p class="p-1">I love Colorado and the outdoors, most of my spare time is spent outside. I love road biking, snowboarding and doing Crossfit. My wife Stephanie
				and I love concerts and spend the summer seeing our favorite bands. We became hockey fans when the Quebec Nordiques moved to Colorado in 1996.  My son started
				playing hockey when he turned 8 and played throughout high school. We called our daughters rink rats, because of the amount of time we all spent traveling to different ice rinks.  He is now a sophomore in college wanting to pursue
				audio engineering.
				</p>
				<p class="p-1"> My oldest daughter is the strongest person in our family because she was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was only 3 years old.  We just passed her 13th anniversary
				of living with this disease.  We raise money to support the American Diabetes Association every year by riding in the Tour de Cure fundraiser.  Our family team has raised
				close to $250,000.000 for the ADA.  She is a huge role model for those living with Diabetes and is always encouraging them to keep up the fight!  I couldn't be
				more proud!  She also shoots archery and competes in monthly tournaments.
				</p>
				<p class="p-1">The baby of the family is now in 8th grade. Between her, my wife and I there is a lot of competition on who is funnier!  I do have the advantage because of the
				amount of dad jokes out there.  She likes trying out different sports.  She played, soccer, ran track, competed in gymnastics and recently started playing volleyball at school.
				</p>
				<p class="p-1">I am truly blessed with a great family and career.  I love technology and enjoy learning new things every chance I get.
